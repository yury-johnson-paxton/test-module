# Doxygen auto generation {#mainpage}

This repo is to demonstrate what could be done with github actions and doxygen.

Doxygen markup is something that we include in most sorce code.
We can use github actions to autogenerate documentation.

Some doxygen comments may need to be updated to improve output but we should be able to get a large amount 
of improvement with little work.
